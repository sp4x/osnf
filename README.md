# Open Sensor Network Framework

OSNF is an extensible framework for building and managing sensor networks with common and cheap hardware like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

In the OSNF design, a network is made up of several interconnected nodes, each node runs and instance of OSNF and is connected to one or more stations, which directly manage sensors and collect data.

OSNF exposes realtime data gathered from the whole network through a RESTful web service.
